# Description
This is a simple project that uses OpenCV and the HandTrackingModule from cvzone to recognize how many fingers are raised up, lighting up the same number of LEDs. 
If needed, install dependencies by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
pip install opencv-python cvzone
